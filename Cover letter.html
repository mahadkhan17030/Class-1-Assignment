    <h3>Dear Mr. KHAN</h3>
    <p>I'm writing to you regarding your company's Customer Service Representative opening. I've been working as a
        Telephone Sales Executive at Telemarketer Auto Insurance USA for more than 2 years and have been developed
        impeccable phone manners, and an ability to deal with agitated or distressed customers. I'm accustomed to
        working on multiple projects simultaneously, and I can offer new ideas to help your company grow and surpass all
        goals and objectives.</p>
    <p>My relevent experiance includes the following highlights:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Making 6 cold calls a day to business and private indivisuals to solicit sales of goods and services.</li>
        <li>Implementing a new sales strategy that reduced training expenses by 30% and increased the close ratio by 10%
            within 3 months.</li>
        <li>Maintaining an average 95% customers satisfaction rating.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>My experiance at Telemarketer Auto Insurance USA has helped me improve my leadership skills, allowed me to gain
        prganizational skills, and provided me with extensive knowledge of how to upsell services and goods to potential

        hotel. Additionally, I trained and supervised 6 new staff members.</p>
    <p> I'm looking forward to discussing my qualifications with you in more detail soon. I feel confident that I fulfill the requirements for your open ustomer Service Representative position. Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
